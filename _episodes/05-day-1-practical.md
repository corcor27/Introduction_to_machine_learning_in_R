# Excercise 2
[Download File](../fig/penguins.csv)

Please use the download link to be able to access the penguin dataset which will be used for this exercise.

Task 1:

Using the penguin dataset do some k-means clustering using the features: bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g and species as the labels. Use any combination of the features you want. 
Please produce a plot of your results of k-means.
Do the same again but with Spectral clustering and a plot would be nice.

Task 2:

Now its time to do some dimensional reduction, so using PCA and Tsne please create a plot of your data using each method. 
If you want to be adventurous, try reducing them to 3 dimension and creating a 3D plot. 

Task 3:

Have ago at fitting a linear and Logistic Regression models to your data. again plots would be nice.
