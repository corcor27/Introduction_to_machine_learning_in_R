# Excercise 2
[Download File](../fig/penguins.csv)

Please use the download link to be able to access the penguin dataset which will be used for this exercise.

Task 1:

Using the penguin dataset create a KNN and SVM model using the features: bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g and species as the labels. 
see if you can get your model to generate some predictions. how do they preform?

Task 2:

Now it time to create yourself a deep learning neural network to generate some predictions. again how does it perform? Have ago at altering the number of layers and see if you get a performance increase.

Task 3:

Have a think of what you believe are the ethical implications of machine learning. what could be the biggest benefit's and what are the dangers.
